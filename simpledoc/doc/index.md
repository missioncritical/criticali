## Overview

The simpledoc package is a documentation generator for PHP. It is a simple and straight-forward generator written from the ground up using [PHP-Parser](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser). It currently targets only HTML as an output format. The default format does not use frames, and the intention of this package is to allow custom output formats to be created using well-known templating libraries.
